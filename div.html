    <blockquote><p><b> Countless students in India choose Computer Science as a major because of the promising career opportunities. Students who major in this field learn academic skills like programming, problem-solving, and leadership, among others. Computer science is used in a variety of settings, including colleges, hospitals, and financial institutions. Because of the high demand for computer science and technology in the industry, B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering courses have grown in popularity, allowing students to work as Systems Analysts, Web Developers, Finance Programmers, Software Engineers, Product Managers, Game Developers, and other roles.</b></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><i><p>Computer scientists are among the highest-paid professionals on the planet, as their expertise enables companies to keep up with changing technologies. Since trained professionals are in short supply in fields like computer defence and artificial intelligence, there are plenty of interesting job openings. Additionally, with the advancement of data technology, robotics, and machine learning, computer engineers are in high demand these days. All of these 21st-century jobs pay well, with an average annual salary of INR 6,20,244 in India.</p></i></blockquote>
